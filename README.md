# atomic-schematic
Atomic-Umbrella here.
I enjoy subway(eat flesh), computers(obviously), TACOS, The oatmeal (check him out here http://theoatmeal.com) and Java. I spend most of my time probably similar to you, slouched in front of a computer but you probably know that already. In this repository I will be trying to learn how to make PCB board designs. I will post my progress and if you happen to find anything wrong, tell me about it or change it as all the files will be in a src folder.
